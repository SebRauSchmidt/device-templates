# Device Templates for ESPHome
This repository aims to simplify maintenance for various ESPHome devices in my home. Every device gets a dashboard import function to shorten the installation time on recent changes and to keep upkeep for inactive devices as small as possible. Feel free to use these templates for your own devices and i am thankful for every contribution from you! At the moment of writing this, my yaml files are all poorly documented and not really organized but my goal is to migrate my devices asap to this repository and then clean things up.

### Automated validating
I want every configuration file to be automatically validated by esphome, but this feature needs a little bit more time to implement. When it is implemented, each new device needs to be added via a pull- or merge-request, so that tests can be run before adding the device to the main branch.

### Under construction
This readme isn't finished yet, expect new things to come...
